Automatic Pill Dispenser

Pharmabot is a Raspi based pill dispenser built towards senior citizens who have trouble remembering which pills to take when. It uses a dictionary and lookup to keep track of each pill and dispenses them accordingly. 
It then uses SMTP servers to email a secure email for a confirmation of dispensal. 

Work in progress (lol)
